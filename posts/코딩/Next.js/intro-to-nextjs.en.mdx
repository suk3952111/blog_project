# Introduction to Next.js

Next.js is a React-based framework offering server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and various optimization features.

## The Difference Between SSR and SSG

Next.js provides two main rendering methods: SSR and SSG. SSR renders content from the server on each request, while SSG generates content statically at build time.

```javascript
// SSR example
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  // Fetch data from the server
  return {
    props: {}, // Props to be passed to the page component
  };
}
```

```javascript
// SSG example
export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  // Fetch data at build time
  return {
    props: {}, // Props to be passed to the page component
  };
}
```

## Advantages of Next.js

Next.js offers various features for development efficiency and performance optimization. For example, it includes image optimization, internationalization (i18n), and environment variable settings.
