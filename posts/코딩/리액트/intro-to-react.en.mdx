# Introduction to React

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this article, we will explore the basic concepts of React.

## Introducing JSX

JSX is an extension of JavaScript syntax, used with React to describe UI structure in an intuitive way.

```jsx
function Hello(props) {
  return <div>Hello, {props.name}</div>;
}
```

## Components and Props

In React, components are pieces of the UI. You can pass data to components using props.

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```
