# CSS Basics

CSS is a language used to define the style of web pages.

## CSS Selectors

You can use CSS selectors to select HTML elements and apply styles to them.

```css
p {
  color: blue;
}
```

## Box Model

Every HTML element is represented as a box model. This model includes margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

```css
.box {
  margin: 10px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  padding: 20px;
}
```
